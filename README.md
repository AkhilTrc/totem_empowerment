# Be Empowered to Invent

This is an attempt to study how the Exploration by Empowerment Heuristic can be used to characterize the dynamic space of Inventions. 

Follow-up from the [Empowerment contributes to exploration behaviour in a creative video game](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01661-2) paper by BrÃ¤ndle et al.

And trying to update the research gaps found in the [Not by Transmission Alone](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rstb.2020.0049) paper  by Perry et al. 

## First follow the instructions to install the "fastText" package

## If you encounter a "Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required" error:

1. Download and install Microsoft C++ Build Tools from:
   [Visual Studio C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

2. During installation, ensure you select "C++ build tools" under Workloads.

3. After installation, restart your computer and try the installation again.
