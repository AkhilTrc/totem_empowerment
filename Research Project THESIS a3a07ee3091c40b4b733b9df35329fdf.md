# ~~Initial Notes~~

1. We discuss how social learning provides the basis for a range of more complex social phenomena, such as conformity and cultural traditions.
2. The central discussion of how Domain-general principles of Learning and Social cognition jointly contribute to Social learning. 
3. Outlining the functions of learning in terms of its underlying computations and social learning strategies (SLS), respectively.
4. We discuss how social learning provides the basis for a range of more complex social phenomena, such as conformity and cultural traditions.
5. Ideas from learning theory, cognitive science and artificial intelligence have converged on a unified framework ‚Äî Reinforcement learning ‚Äî to describe how agents learn to maximize rewards minimize punishments [9,10]. A core idea of RL is that agents form expectations about the value of possible actions environmental states (for example, stimuli) through error-minimizing mechanisms.
6. In contrast to the inflexibility of the Pavlovian system, the instrumental system assigns value to actions based on their reinforcement history, which guides adaptive action selection.
7. Our meta-social learning framework provides a means to examine complex population dynamics, thereby helping us better understand the fundamental nature of biological learning and decision making [15, 26, 39]. 
    1. For example, our meta-social learning principle would provide theoretical insight into why animals or humans often copy others‚Äô behavior and why society needs to achieve conformity, especially in highly volatile situations. 
    2. The meta-social learning scheme can be extended to explain various types of ecological interactions, such as symbiosis, mimicry, mutualism and cooperation [54].
8. Social learning aims to benefit from the collective property of multi-agent systems to provide efficient learning and adaptation as a population.
9. Meta-social learning strategies can play a key role in these kinds of distributed learning applications to improve the efficiency of learning.
    1. For instance, one recent example of distributed learning approach has been used in healthcare to detect illnesses [64]. 
10. It would be possible to estimate the environment uncertainty and volatility simply by measuring individual choice variability. 
11.  Exciting research direction is to use meta-social learning to examine the fundamental nature of social networks [67]. 
    1. Investigation of fundamental computations underlying the emergence and evolution of social networks would allow us to understand and predict the future of animal societies. 
    2. Furthermore, the computational framework of meta-social learning be used to test new hypotheses about multi-agent social learning [68, 69].
        1. For instance, it is possible to test whether complex internal dynamics arising from meta-social learning promote the natural emergence of curriculum. 

## Factors that may constitute ‚Äú*Attention‚Äù*

1. Point of origin of a trend.
2. Loudness of the information from the origin. 
3. Loudness of the nodes that perpetrate the information throughout the network. 
4. Size of the network.
5. Tendency to create new networks.

# Cultural Evolution - Glossary

- **Culture**: information capable of affecting individuals‚Äô behaviors that is acquired from other individuals via social transmission.
- **Cultural evolution**: the change of cultural information over time; the key properties for an evolutionary process are variation, transmission and selection.
- **Social learning**: learning that is influenced by the observation of another individual or their products.
- **AI**: the science and technology enabling machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perceiving the environment, planning and executing actions, and adapting by learning from data or experience.
- **Machines**: intelligent machines. Used interchangeably with AI systems, thus referring to machines that may possess capabilities to perceive the environment, plan and execute actions, and adapt by learning from data or experience.
- **Variation**: the existence of different cultural traits within a population. It represents the raw material on which other processes, such as selection and transmission, operate. Humans and machines add to existing cultural variation through random and guided exploration, as well as recombination of existing cultural traits.
- **Transmission**: the process by which cultural information, such as knowledge, behaviors, traditions or practices, is passed from one individual to another through social learning mechanisms such as observation or teaching.
- **Selection**: the process by which certain cultural traits, practices or ideas become more or less prevalent in a population over time due to differential adoption.\
- **Exploration as Empowerment**: can be formalized as the attempt to create elements that can be used to create even more elements.

# Solo-Brain-storming #1: 29/11/2023 - 01/12/2023

1. I tried inverting the original idea proposed for the thesis, i.e. to use computation or AI models to study Cultural Evolution. But how about, ***how Artificial-Intelligence (AI) itself affects Cultural Evolution (CE)?*** 
    1. We know that with the advent of the Internet age in the early 2000s, information flow has become vastly quicker and easily malleable than ever before. Until now, people across the world searched for information via popular search engines such as Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc. These search engines are in-effect just a broker between the users and the published information-material, posted by other people(s), online. Google for example uses many methods and techniques to prioritize and present these published materials via systems such as ‚ÄúPageRank‚Äù, ‚ÄúSEC‚Äù, ‚ÄúSearch-Indexing‚Äù etc. Essentially keeping it a human-to-human communication channel. Although not direct, humans are still the sender and the receiver on this system. Human intent to Human intent.  
    2. With the inclusion of AI in this dynamic, pseudo-intents are being created and consumed. Meaning that, the information presented is created by an Artificial Entity. For example, it is well known that Chat-GPT is often not a reliable source of information. It often sites made-up scientific literature and fake sources about the claims it makes. What is this doing in changing the cultural landscape of hitherto assumed human-to-human transfer of information? ***How can this be modelled?***

[Hybrid social learning in human-algorithm cultural transmission](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rsta.2020.0426)

- Replaying historic human matches of the last 300 years showed that an algorithm similar to AlphaGo Zero increasingly often chooses the same move as humans, indicating convergence towards a common gameplay.
- These observations suggest the fascinating hypothesis that increased alignment is the result of a hybrid form of social learning, where AI solutions are copied and maintained by humans.
- Potential Hypothesis: ***Social learning between humans and algorithms may be especially beneficial when biological and artificial problem solvers show diversity in the heuristics and strategies they adopt to problem-solving.***
- In this study, we focus on a specific human bias, namely ***the tendency for myopic behavior when facing a sequential decision.***
    - For example.
        - An example of myopic behavior in the context of social media can be observed in the case of viral trends or challenges. When individuals observe others participating in a trend or challenge, they may be inclined to join in without fully considering the potential consequences or long-term implications. This behavior can lead to a cascade effect, where the actions of one individual influence the actions of others, creating a trend that spreads rapidly through the social media platform. However, this trend may not be based on careful consideration or rational decision-making, but rather on the desire to conform to the actions of others and gain short-term social validation.
    - Interesting Papers about this.
        - Analyses of the behavior of individual young adults demonstrated that temporal discounting is better described by hyperbola-like functions than by exponential decay functions. For most individuals, the parameter that determines the rate of discounting varied inversely with amount. Raising the denominator of the discounting function to a power resulted in better descriptions of the data from most subjects. Two possible derivations of the temporal discounting function are proposed, a repeated choice model and an expected value model. These provide theoretical interpretations for amount-dependent discounting but amount-independent exponent parameters.

        - We designed a new sequential reinforcement-based task and showed that human subjects adopted a simple pruning strategy: ***during mental evaluation of a sequence of choices, they curtailed any further evaluation of a sequence as soon as they encountered a large loss***. This pruning strategy was Pavlovian: it was reflexively evoked by large losses and persisted even when overwhelmingly counterproductive.

1. Think about how to apply/transfer the methodologies behind Creative Adversarial Networks (CANs) to generate creative/informed/diverse behaviors within populations &/ generations in the context of Cumulative cultural Evolution. 
    1. Look into this paper: [**CAN: Creative Adversarial Networks, Generating "Art" by Learning About Styles and Deviating from Style Norms.**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07068)
    2. The basic idea behind this: ***Capable of generating creative art by maximizing deviation from established styles and minimizing deviation from art distribution.***

2. Supporting Hypothesis: ***Does Diversity/Creativity help in affecting/controlling Myopic behaviors within populations/generations?***  
    1. Will this help in the general progress within the population &/ generation? 
    2. Might have to think about how to model cultural traits as statistical/probabilistic distributions. These papers might be of use:

    1. The study also shows that the effect of empowerment on participants‚Äô exploration strategies vanishes if we remove the semantics of the game. 
    2. There are datasets used in this: Little Alchemy, Tiny Alchemy, Tiny Pixel [**datasets**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01661-2#Sec19).

8. ***What are the outcomes of a tendency to form cultures?***
    1. Given three key elements of the process of ***cultural differentiation***‚Äî(i) that human communities have a tendency to diverge as a product of how biological and social reproduction develops over several generations, (ii) that the species as a whole exploits this tendency through cognitive systems which mark differences between communities, and (iii) that the rate of such fissioning is ecologically and demographically sensitive.

    2. Can I modify and use this to predict future cultural traits/trends over generations?
        1. Can generations be analyzed temporally? 
10. Interesting hypothesis from [**paper**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rsta.2020.0426): ***Increased alignment is the result of a hybrid form of social learning, where AI solutions are copied and maintained by humans.*** 
11. Bayesian approaches can model users‚Äô uncertainty and be used to update algorithmic recommendations as the user interacts with the system. 
12. ***Giving some support to the hypothesis that threat-related information would have a primary role amongst the factors that make stories culturally successful, but further research is needed to substantiate this link.*** [**Paper**](https://www.notion.so/Research-Project-THESIS-a3a07ee3091c40b4b733b9df35329fdf?pvs=21).
    1. Could when the survival of the population (fitness) is under threat (via external/environmental factors), the AI-agent be able to persuade the population into exiting the Myopic behavior (escape the local minima)? 
    2. I suppose this could ‚Äúcatch the Attention‚Äù of the individuals within the population and then Conformity bias will take care of the rest following the deviating trend. 
    3. Look into ***Cultural Attractiveness***.  
    4. Look into ***Transmission Chains***.
    5. How would one study/observe the multi-level abstractions of the formation of cultural traits/trends? 
        1. For example, Writing as a cultural artefact developed before the concept of Books became a cultural artefact. 
13. Can AI-agents be used to induce desirable change (Innovation) within a population / MAS? 
    1. ***Innovations arise when perturbations push parts of the system away from stable equilibria into new regimes where previously well-adapted solutions no longer work. [The Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00742).***
    2. We propose that life solved its own version of **the problem problem** because it is a multiagent system  where any species‚Äô innovation determines the environment to which others must adapt.
    3. The hypothesis that ***multi-agent systems sometimes display intrinsic dynamics arising from competition and cooperation that provide a naturally emergent curriculum, which we term an Autocurriculum.*** 
        1. The argument has two main ingredients. (1)adaptive units must learn implementation policies for their high-level strategies by sequencing low-level action primitives. (2)the high-level strategies themselves change over time in response to the strategic choices of others. Taken together, these two processes induce a sequence of challenges for the adaptive process that we term an **Autocurriculum**.
        2. The solution of one social task often begets new social tasks, continually generating novel challenges, and thereby promoting innovation.
    4. An ***external AI-agent*** can potentially be considered an ***Adaptive unit***. If the AI-agent is capable of learning and adapting based on its interactions with other agents or individuals, it can potentially contribute to the emergence of an Autocurriculum within the system.
    5. ***Can an AI-agent learn the Macro-level behaviors of the populations/MASs and then ‚Äúpersuade‚Äù the population/MAS into exhibiting desired/appropriate outcomes (escaping Myopic behavior / forcing innovation / optimizing for minority/outlier fitness) via exploiting Autocurriculum?*** 
    6. Models predict that **spatially varying environments** will favor cultural transmission, whereas only **highly stable environments** would favor the genetic determination of the behavior. [**Paper**](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1620732114).
    7. In many models of social learning, new information enters a population via trial-and-error learning or individual interactions with the environment, and this information can then be culturally transmitted. 
        1. New cultural traits can also originate when existing traits are **combined in novel ways**, which can lead to exponential rates of cultural accumulation.

## [**Model-free/-based paper**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627313011252?via%3Dihub)

1. A computational framework in which **goal-directed** and **habitual behavior** are expressed as different forms of **Reinforcement learning**. 
    1. Goal-directed learning is described as model-based, in which the agent uses an internal model of the environment in order to compute the value of actions online.
    2. Habitual-control is proposed to be model-free, in that ‚Äúcached‚Äù values for actions are acquired on the basis of trial and error experience without any explicit model of the decision problem being encoded.  
    3. Has been hypothesized: ***An arbitrator evaluates the performance of each of these systems and sets the degree of control that each system has over behavior according to the reliability of those predictions.*** 
2. ***Is the model-based approach comparable to the Semantic format of the Totem Game?*** - The given semantics being the model in this case.
3. **The Arbitration model.**
    1. The arbitration model consists of three levels of computation: model-based/model-free learning, reliability estimation, and reliability competition. The first layer consists of model-based and model-free learning, which generate the state prediction error (SPE) and reward prediction error (RPE), respectively. The second layer provides an estimation of reliability for the two learning models. Specifically, we start with a standard Bayesian framework that formally dictates prior successes and failures in predicting task contingencies in the form of prediction error (PE). The next layer provides a competition between the two reliabilities. This bottom-up design allows us to systematically test six types of arbitration strategies. 
    2. SPE is close to zero ‚Üí model-based system has a good and reliable estimate of the world. To make these reliability inferences for:
        1. $Rel_{MB}$: model-based system, we formulated a bottom-up Bayesian model that estimates the probability that the SPE is set to zero at a particular moment in time. The reliability of the model-based ($Rel_{MB}$) is defined as the ratio of the mean prediction and the uncertainty of that prediction for SPE, a variance-to-mean ratio that is formally known as an **Inverse of the index of dispersion**. 
    3. RPEs are minimal ‚Üí model-free system likely has a very accurate estimate of the expected reward available for different actions at that moment in time. 
        1. A similar Bayesian framework could also be used, substituting the RPE for the SPE - ***dualBayesArb* model**.
        2. Instead of sophisticated Bayesian machinery to estimate reliability, use the absolute value of the RPE signal to learn trial-by-trial predictions about the degree of reliability of the RPE in a model-free manner - ***mixedArb* model**.
    4. The **Competing Mechanism**:
        1. A dynamical two-state transition rule: allows these two reliability indices to compete with each other in order to set a weight (model-choice probability $P_{MB}$) that governs the extent to which the MB vs. MF systems control behavior. 
            1. $P_{MB}$ is high ‚Üí control is dominated by the MB system.
            2. $P_{MB}$ is low ‚Üí control is dominated by the MF system. 
    5. Should I consider computational demands? 

## **Notes and observations.**

- I suppose we are strictly adhering to the Model-based for structuring the framework for the semantic version of the Totem game?
    1. But, the Arbitration Model can also be used to study pattern inference from the participants in the non-semantic case? Might be complicated. 
    2. On the other hand, the model-based MDP approach can be used to study the participants‚Äô approach to solving the Totem Game? - To study choice behavior in this case.   
- Arbitration Model can be used to study variation in subject‚Äôs choice behavior in the Totem Game?
- **Totem Game** as a **Multiple-choice Markov decision task**.
    1. We are trying to observe the exploration drives:
        1. Intrinsic drive (Empowerment) of the participants (Individual); 
        2. Not just intrinsic, but other methods as well. Elaborated on further down; 
        3. In groups (collective choice behavior). 
    2. Interesting [**Paper**](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11672142_26) for Multiple-objective MDP.
    3. Hypothetical design schematics: [**Link to method**](https://www.notion.so/Constructing-a-sequential-multiple-choice-Markov-decision-task-c01329a6375c4e55bcbba990d8562317?pvs=21). 
    4. This can be first simulated using bots. Then verified by participant study if needed. 
        1. Follow-up with the learning bot simulation in the [**Totem paper**](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9398#Fig2:~:text=facilitate%20statistical%20analyses).-,Bots,Isolated%20bots%20generated%20combinations,-through%20a%20two). 
- What might be the priors (these are based on what the participants are made aware before the game)?
    1. The ultimate goal: the structure/design of the Totem - 266,915 unique totems. The design of a totem is the end goal, and thus participants start by aligning that with the choice of their tool creations and innovations.
        1. Follows a Teleological approach to solving the problem at hand. 
    2. Semantic sense: participants start with using and combining items by the sensical use via the semantics of the items. This narrows the usability/combination margin of those initial (or subsequent) ‚Äúraw materials‚Äù. 
    3. No. of stock panel limitation: only 12 panels given. This might constrain the use of them and might make the participants more conservative in using these spaces. 
    4. Score value and informed rewards: Players were also informed that their score, and their monetary reward depended on the number of new items they were able to produce and the value of their totem. 
        1. Might make urgent the need to acquire rewards by the creation of new items. Participants may focus on this aspect. 
    5. Possibility of innovations? Having previously informed participants about potential need of innovations, might produce creative combinations.  
        1. More Innovations lead to more score for the subsequent logs. How would participants strategies based on this awareness? 
        2. Our results indicate that the number of unsuccessful combinations that players had to generate before producing a successful one was negatively affected by the rank of the innovation, indicating that players got better at generating successful combinations across time. From [**Totem Paper**](https://www.notion.so/7097c82a9f2842aba07df48b6847dc61?pvs=21). 
- To study group behavior in the Totem Game.
    1. Characterize the the type of task the Totem game is: [**This paper**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01305-2#Sec15) explores the effect the task type/features has on group performance. 
        1. The complexity of task.
        2. Easy-to-hard, or, Hard-to-easy task?
        3. Coarse-grained or fine-grained task?
    2. Challenging tasks elicit greater conformity among individuals, with rates of copying increasing with group size, leading to high probabilities of herding among large groups confronted with uncertainty. [**Paper**](https://www.notion.so/7097c82a9f2842aba07df48b6847dc61?pvs=21).
- Considering motivation for choice behavior by the Empowerment or Other Choice Behavior Models: people seem to take into account how empowering the outcomes of their actions are.
    1. How can Exploration of raw material combinations for innovation and tool creation be motivated? 
        1. Has potential in extrinsic-reward-less situations. This might be used to test intrinsic exploration strategies (Empowerment - attempt to create elements that can be used to create even more elements). 
            1. Applicable to the semantic version. 
        2. Quantify Empowerment value of combinations into account as a fitness/success measure. 
        3. Link Prediction might also be applicable here? 
        4. Powerplay strategies to learn hidden game mechanics: [**Paper**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23761771/).  
            1. *Training an Increasingly General Problem Solver by Continually Searching for the Simplest Still Unsolvable Problem.* 
            2. Find (task, solver) pairs iteratively that reduces the search space and computational complexity by inventing new tasks and accompanied solvers that has the ability to solve previous tasks. 
            3. More than Generalization. PowerPlay‚Äôs ongoing
            search is continually testing (and always trying to go beyond) the generalization abilities of the most recent solver instance; some of its search time has to be spent on demonstrating that self-invented new tasks are not already solvable. 
            4. Modified RNNs can be used to implement this.
            5. Implementation can also be based on Stochastic or Evolutionary Search.
        5. Can look into Goal-conditioned exploration: [**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08453).
            1. Example: Having the goal of creating an axe would probably lead to a different exploration path through the game tree than the goal of creating a pain brush. 
            2. Can look into how this forces divergence in subsequent tool creation and innovation. 
            3. This might lead to multiple parallel paths. Especially in group dynamics. 
    2. Thus, we believe that games such as ‚ÄòLittle Alchemy‚Äô can be used to reverse-engineer people‚Äôs intuitive semantics and use them to model human exploration. 
        1. Applicable in the semantic version of the Totem Game? To trace the path via reverse-engineering back to something aligning the Totem game rule set?

## Implementing Empowerment model on the AI-bot

1. 2 types of exploration strategies studied here: 
    1. **Uncertainty-guided Exploration:** 
        1. Eg, assume an uncertainty bonus that encourages the sampling of options that have not been sampled frequently in the past. 
        2. Eg, In ‚ÄòLittle Alchemy 2‚Äô, an uncertainty-guided strategy would correspond to tracking how often one has used particular elements before and then using the elements more that have not been used frequently. 
        3. Uncertainty Value ${U}_{e}=\sqrt{\frac{\log (T)}{{t}_{e}+1}}$
    2. **Exploration as Empowerment:**
        1. Our central hypothesis is that there exist a local and universal utility function which may help individuals survive and hence speed up evolution by making the fitness landscape smoother.
        2. Intuition: The unifying theme of these and many other examples is the striving towards situations where in the long term one could do many different things if one wanted to, where one has more control or influence over the world. 
        3. **Empowerment** is the perceived amount of influence or control the agent has over the world. 
            1. E.g. if the agent can make one hundred different actions but the result, as perceived by the agent, is always the same, the agent has no control over the world whatsoever. 
            2. If, on the other hand, the agent can reliably force the world into two states distinguishable by the agent, it has two options and thus two futures to choose from. 
2. Using uncertainty(-guided) about the available options.
3. The study of empowerment, for example, requires a change of influence on future options. 
4. An intuitive understanding of which actions can be empowering, for example by using an intuitive understanding of which objects in a game can be combined. 
5. Algorithmic ideas behind uncertainty-guided exploration and exploration as empowerment:
    1. 
6. About Little Alchemy 2: Players do not play for rewards but instead are intrinsically motivated to explore the game tree and create new elements. It offers a rich and semantically meaningful structure, which probes humans‚Äô intuitions about the combinability of its elements.
7. Empowerment can be seen as the agent‚Äôs potential to change the world, that is, how much the agent could do in principle. This is in general different from the actual change the agent inflicts.
8. Definition: Empowerment is seen as the actuation channel of the agent. 
9. Empowerment can be calculated on-board in an agent-centric way or externally, as, for example, a fitness function in evolutionary search.

2. Quantify the amount of influence as the amount of Shannon information the agent could ‚Äúimprint onto‚Äù or ‚Äúinject into‚Äù the sensor. Any such information will have to pass through the agent‚Äôs actuator. 
3. **n-step sensor empowerment**: Assuming that the agent is allowed to perform any actions for n time steps, what is the maximum amount of information it can ‚Äúinject‚Äù into the momentary reading of its sensor after these n time steps? 
    1. The more of the information can be made to appear in the sensor, the more control or influence the agent has over its sensor.

## The Affordance Paper

<aside>
üí° The paper: [***Learning Affordance Landscapes for Interaction Exploration in 3D Environments.***](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09241) ‚Äå

</aside>

1. We envision embodied agents that can enter a novel 3D environment, move around to encounter new objects, and autonomously discern the affordance landscape‚Äîwhat are the interactable objects, what actions are relevant to use them, and under what conditions will these interactions succeed?
2. Towards addressing these challenges, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach in which the agent discovers the affordance landscape of a new, unmapped 3D environment. The result is a strong prior for where to explore and what interactions to try. Quick working model:
    1. We reward the agent for quickly interacting with all objects in an environment.
    2. In parallel, we train an affordance model online to segment images according to the likelihoods for each of the agent‚Äôs actions succeeding there, using the partially observed interaction data generated by the exploration policy. 
    3. The two models work in concert to functionally explore the environment.
3. Only for Visual Affordances: The proposed agent actively seeks new affordances via exploratory interactions with a dynamic environment.
4. We study the problem of exploration for interaction in dynamic environments where the agent can modify the environment state (open/close doors, pick up objects etc.). 
5. The goal is to quickly interact with as many objects
as possible in a new environment- **exploration for interaction** promotes rapidly completing the agent‚Äôs understanding of its interactions in a dynamic environment. 
- **Basic Approach**
    1.  ****

## Translating *Affordance* to Totem Game

- **A Hypothetical approach**
    - *A agent can learn to recognize the affordances of different objects in the game environment and use this information to determine which objects can be combined to create new elements. The agent can also learn to recognize patterns in the game environment and use these patterns to predict the outcomes of different actions. Using [**Hierarchical Affordance Learning (HAL)**](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=7b4zxUnrO2N) perhaps? [**Another paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15085).*
1. An Embodied agent that can enter a novel ~~3D~~ Totem game environment (images/labels of the raw materials perhaps), ~~move around~~ choose randomly to encounter new ~~objects~~ raw materials, and autonomously discern the affordance landscape‚Äîwhat are the ~~interactable~~ usable ~~objects~~ raw-materials/combinations, what ~~actions~~ raw-materials/combinations are relevant to use them, and under what conditions will these ~~interactions~~ choices succeed? 
2. **Exploration for interaction problem in the Totem game**: a mobile agent in a Totem game environment must autonomously discover the raw-materials/combinations with which it can use/combine with, and what actions are valid as combinations with them. 
    1. Some raw-materials‚Äô/combinations‚Äô dynamics are not straightforward - e.g. cannot make the same combined tool again; cannot create some combinations with some prior combinations already made, etc. 
3. **Figuring-out the Semantics**: A deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach in which the agent discovers the affordance landscape of a new, unmapped raw-material list/environment. The result is a strong prior for where to explore and what raw-materials/combinations to try. 
4. **Sensors & Actuators**: Specifically, we consider an agent equipped with an ~~egocentric RGB-D camera~~ observable raw-material space and an action space comprised of ~~navigation and manipulation actions (turn left, open, toggle, etc.)~~ raw-material combinations, whose effects (i.e. combination-results/rule-sets) are initially unknown to the agent. 
5. **Model components**: 
    1. **Model #1**: Reward the agent for quickly interacting with all raw-materials in the environment. 
    2. **Model** **#2**: In parallel, train an affordance model online to segment states according to the likelihoods for each of the agent‚Äôs combinations succeeding there, using the partially observed combination data generated by the exploration policy. 
    3. The two Models work in concert to functionally explore the choice-environment.

1. Explore the effects of **Cultural Recombination** in choice-behavior games such as the TG or LA2 to study how participants make choices for novel combinations/innovations, and analyze these patterns.  
    1. Certain combinations of cultural heuristic artefacts can be combined and tested on the game. Verify via cross-reference with human data. 

## Machine Cultural influence in Choice-behavior games

1. How presenting Machine-Learning-generated insights of playing the game informs human participants, and study how that affects human performance. Paper: [**Human Learning from Artificial Intelligence: Evidence from Human Go Players‚Äô Decisions after AlphaGo.](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6q05n7pz)** 
    1. Use Reinforcement-Learning/Genetic-Algorithm to simulate/play choice-behavior games (such as TG/LA2) iteratively and present the winning/successful insights generated from it and present it to human participants and see how performance improves compared to a AI-less baseline.  
    2. How will the study look? 
        1. Initially studying the playing methods of the participants and recording them - First couple of weeks/months. 
        2. Perform the algorithm (Empowerment/Affordances/RL/GA) driven simulation/analysis of the game using AI-bots. Study the novel approaches, innovations or heuristics that AI-bot makes and record them. 
            1. Supporting article: [**Humans have improved at Go since AIs became best in the world.**](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2364137-humans-have-improved-at-go-since-ais-became-best-in-the-world/)
        3.  Introduce these AI-bot identified heuristics to human participants down the line and separate experiment after couple of months. Study and analyze how the human performance has evolved after having presented them with these new heuristics. 
2. Look into **Decision Quality index** (DQI). 
    1. This assesses the quality of a move. They deemed a move ‚Äúnovel‚Äù if it had not been previously attempted in combination with the preceding moves.
3. Our analysis of 1.3 million move decisions made by professional Go players suggests that people learned to make decisions like AI after they observe ***reasoning processes*** of AI, rather than mere actions of AI. Our results demonstrate that humans can learn from AI even in a complex domain where the computation process of AI is also complicated.

**Potential RQs**:  

- How does the Affordance landscape perceived by an embodied-RL agent contribute to Exploration as Empowerment?
- Some commonalities between the use of model-based MDPs in both Empowerment and Affordance. So, with the same frame-work to emulate human intuition of semantics, both the heuristics can be modelled to simulate the gameplay and study how much it explains human behavior (and improves over it?) using value loss analysis.

</aside>

1. Empowerment is the perceived amount of influence or control
the agent has over the world.
    1. E.g. If the agent can make one hundred different actions but the result, as perceived by the agent, is always the same, the agent has no control over the world whatsoever. If, on the other hand, the agent can reliably force the world into two states distinguishable by the agent, it has two options and thus two futures to choose from.
2. Quantify the amount of influence as the amount of **Shannon information2** the agent could ‚Äúimprint onto‚Äù or ‚Äúinject into‚Äù the sensor.
    1. The more of the information can be made to appear in the sensor, the more control or influence the agent has over its sensor. 
3. Mathematically, we define **Empowerment** as the channel capacity of the agent‚Äôs actuation channel terminating at the sensor. 
    1. The system‚Äôs dynamics induce a conditional probability distribution between the sequence of actions and the state of sensor after n time steps. This conditional distribution describes the communication channel (connected to channel capacity) we need. 
    2. **Empowerment** is measured in bits. 
        1. It is zero when the agent has no control over what it is sensing. 
        2. It is higher the more perceivable control or influence the agent has. 
4. **Exploration as Empowerment (EaE)** formalized as the attempt to create elements that can be used to create even more elements. 
    1. Centers around the idea of exploring options that enable the generation of as many more options as possible. 
    2. **EaE** focuses on the intrinsic drive towards a state of maximum influence. 
5. While empowerment is not designed to explicitly favor exploration, it has an inbuilt incentive to avoid behavior that leads to a robot being stuck.
6. We call an **element empowering** the more distinct elements it can lead to by combination with all other possible elements in the game, provided that the true game tree is known.
7. Afterwards, we address people‚Äôs intuitive semantic understanding of the game and how an approximation of this understanding can be integrated into the empowerment model.
8. This suggests that people incorporate the empowerment value of the different elements in their decision to immediately use a newly created element. 
9. We analyzed whether the motivation to continue playing is more influenced by the recent creation of successful combinations, or by the recent creation of empowering elements.
    1. Players‚Äô decisions to continue the game were mostly influenced by how empowering recently created elements were.
10. We tested the performance of the empowerment approach by creating a model based on the empowerment values of the actual underlying game tree of the original game and compared this model to a random choice, an oracle, and an
uncertainty-based exploration model. 
    1. The empowerment model bases its decisions on the empowerment value of the possible combinations.

# Outline:

## What we are testing?

- LLM model fails to perform the game well.
- Added Semantics built by using LLMs or Word-Embeddings or other knowledge models, and using our proposals- exploratory heuristics (Empowerment/Affordance/causal-understanding models) to play the game. Prove this helps improve the gameplay performance.

## Take an LLM model (such as ChatGPT) and use to try to solve our problem

## The Heuristics used to resemble human intuition (Test conditions) - Exploratory Heuristics

- The **Exploratory Heuristics**.
    - **Empowerment**
        1. First, an **Oracle-based** initial study: Semantics from the pure game rule-set.
        2. Then, other tools, **LLMs-based**, **Word-Embeddings**, etc.
    - **Affordance**
        1. Structuring Affordance to optimize action-selection.

## For knowledge and reasoning model - Models to guide/accelerate the gaming process - Creating World Representations

- Using **Exploratory heuristics** such as Empowerment, Affordance or other Causal-understanding models to guide the agent in playing the game.
- These are **Model-based** in their methodologies. Thus needs Semantic understanding of the game world.
    - This is where a method to construct a ‚ÄúWorld Representation‚Äù of the game environment is required.
        - **Oracle** (Pure game-rule setting): Using the defined rule-set of the game to perform agent simulation. [**Paper**](https://www.notion.so/Research-Project-THESIS-a3a07ee3091c40b4b733b9df35329fdf?pvs=21).
            - Oracle model knows the actual game tree and chooses combinations that always result in the discovery of a new element, thus simulating the behavior of a perfect agent.
            - High potential to reach direct convergence, but can be used to test the applicability of the Empowerment/Affordance models.
        - **Pure Word-Embeddings**: An established structure that represents the meaning and relationships of and between the elements by the vector-representations of the elements. [**Paper**](https://neptune.ai/blog/word-embeddings-guide).

## Not by Transmission Alone paper (NbyTA)

üí° Paper: [**Not by transmission alone: the role of invention in cultural evolution.**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rstb.2020.0049)

</aside>

1. **Innovation** (as an adaptive Strategy)‚Äîthe combination of invention and social learning.
    1. **Invention**: When an individual stochastically (randomly?) produces a behavior it has never performed or seen performed before, we call that novel behavior an invention. 
    2. The extensive social transmission of novel behavioral variants is called **Innovation**. 
        1. ‚Ä¶likely to be an adaptive strategy in many species. 
        2. ‚Ä¶we emphasize the importance of investigating invention as a critical source of variation and thus a driver of cultural evolution.
        3.  ‚Ä¶also largely neglected the cognitive-computational processes involved in producing inventions. 
    3. Typically, a behavior is not described as an invention if it is acquired via successful social learning.
    4. Notably, we do not require inventions or innovations to be fitness-enhancing for individuals or groups. 
2. We use the term **Innovation** to refer to inventions that succeed in diffusing widely through a (sub)group to become stable characteristics of that (sub)group.
    1. We use ‚Äòinnovation‚Äô to refer to process and ‚Äòan innovation‚Äô to refer to product. 
3. The basic question being left unanswered: 
    1. What factors promote the creation of new ideas and practices? 
    2. What affects their spread or loss? 
4. During rapid environmental changes, new fitness-enhancing behaviors that exploit novel aspects of the environment and are socially transmitted to conspecifics.
5. One challenge in defining new behaviors is deciding how finely to parse behavioral sequences.
6. Document all the behaviors that have been witnessed. We can then assess their relative invent-ability by noting how often they appear in individual and group repertoires, taking into account exposure to appropriate contexts for displaying these behaviors. 
7. As formal models of creativity suggest, inventions that are close to existing behaviors are easier to create. 

## Potential Hypotheses & Notes (*Drivers of Innovation!*)

1. Innovations can also be thought of as ‚Äúcomplex memes‚Äù. [**Paper**](https://stevenpinker.com/publications/how-mind-works-19972009). 
2. Determining rates of invention is perhaps the greatest empirical obstacle to research on inventions, closely followed by characterizing the (changing) space of possible inventions (which is necessary to assess what characteristics make inventions more or less likely). 
3. To find what is ‚Äòinvent-able‚Äô: systematically cataloguing the building blocks of species‚Äô inventions (i.e. the behaviors that could be combined in order to create new ones). 
4. Models of cultural evolution have paid very little attention to these issues, treating the space of possible inventions as unstructured. [**Highlight**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rstb.2020.0049#:~:text=Some%20behaviours%20may,inventions%20as%20unstructured.). 
    1. ‚Ä¶distinguish between inventing completely new traits or tools, combining existing ones, and modifying them. This model abstracts away from individual, dyad, and network-level dynamics, and only considers the long-term dynamics of cumulative culture in a population. [**Paper**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2012.0119). 
5. Substantial research on the diffusion of innovations in human groups has examined the characteristics of individuals who transmit and maintain inventions‚Äîeither from the point of view of the learner, the model, or their relationship. 

## Innovations through Collective Dynamics

- **Artificial Creative systems. [Paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-43610-4_14).**
    1. These definitions maintain that creativity has two important but distinct meanings: a person‚Äôs perception of their own work; and, an honorific title awarded by society.
    2. Computational creativity has attempted to address questions around the social nature of creativity in one of two ways: (2) developing computational models of artificial societies that exhibit recognizable features of social creativity.
    3. The second approach requires the development of computational models of salient social and cultural aspects of creativity, e.g., by developing multi-agent based models of creative individuals. 
    4. These definitions maintain that creativity has two important but distinct meanings: a person‚Äôs perception of their own work; and, an honorific title awarded by society.
    5. Vygotsky (1971) first proposed a systems theory of creativity emphasizing a reciprocal relationship between individuals and their socio-cultural environment where individuals are both influenced by their understanding of their socio-cultural environment and through their actions cause it to change.
    6. Regardless of whether creativity is personal or social, it is the result of a dynamic system of interactions between multiple individuals and their socio-cultural environment (Engestrom, 1996).
    7. Csikszentmihalyi (1988), the resulting model defines creativity as the result of the interaction between three subsystems: *a domain, an individual,* and *a field*. The **Domain-Individual-Field-Interaction (DIFI) framework:**
        1. the domain transmits information to the individual, 
        2. the individual produces a variation, and 
        3. the field selects variations to pass on to the domain.
            
            ![Untitled](Untitled.png)
            
- **Innovation in the Collective brain.** [**Paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192?intcmp=trendmd).**
    1. Just as thoughts are an emergent property of neurons firing in our neural  networks, innovations arise as an emergent consequence of our species‚Äô psychology applied within our societies and social networks. 
    2. Our societies and social networks act as collective brains. We outline how many human brains, which evolved primarily for the acquisition of culture, together beget a collective brain. 
    3. Within these collective brains, the three main sources of innovation are: 
        1. Serendipity, 
        2. Recombination [**Paper**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2012.0119), and 
        3. Incremental improvement. 
    4. We argue that rates of innovation are heavily influenced by: 
        1. Sociality, 
        2. Transmission fidelity, and 
        3. Cultural variance.
    5. Innovations (as cultural adaptations) appear functionally well designed
    to meet local problems. 
    6. Finally, we examine some of the ways in which collective brains can feedback to make each of their constituent cultural brains ‚Äòsmarter‚Äô‚Äîor at least cognitively better equipped to deal with local challenges. 
        1. In doing so, we address an understudied aspect of cultural evolution, how culture affects culture; that is, how ideas interact to change the innovation landscape, constraining and opening new *thought spaces*. 
    7. Causing Innovations in the Collective Cultural Brain: 
        1. Innovations also seem to spread as a consequence of a popularizer (‚Äùgreat man‚Äù) achieving the innovation and then spreading it. 
        2. Experimental evidence from a cultural transmission experiment shows that when given access to multiple models, individuals selectively learn from the most successful, but also recombine knowledge from the next most successful models, leading to better outcomes than those who did not have access to many models. [**Paper**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2013.2511#d1e1117).

1. I have been trying to transfer the study methodology and a way to approximate the semantics of the elements of the ‚ÄúRaw materials‚Äù game from the Little Alchemy 2 game study implementing Exploration as Empowerment as a heuristic. 
    1. The most difficult part seems to be approximating the semantics- looking into methods such as Word Embeddings or GPT-based World representations. 
    2. Another is, how an AI agent can be deployed with different random.

1. Characterizing the (changing) space of possible Inventions.
    1. which is necessary  to assess what characteristics make inventions more or less  likely.
2. Qualities of Individuals that promote inventiveness?  
3. Look into the formal models of the Inventive process. 
4. the biggest gap in  our knowledge of social transmission amongst non-humans:  whether individuals ‚Äòprefer‚Äô to learn some inventions over  others‚Äîi.e. whether and how the particular characteristics of  inventions affect their subsequent transmission.

# THESIS Idea: *How can the **Intrinsic Drive to Explore** (e.g. using **Empowerment** in this case) be used to characterize the **Dynamic** (or not) **Space of Possible Inventions**?*

1. Different ways to approach this based on the understanding of **Inventions** (From the [**Not by Transmission Alone paper**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rstb.2020.0049)):
    1. [**What characteristics of *behavioral traits* make them more likely to be invented?**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rstb.2020.0049#:~:text=What%20characteristics%20of,to%20be%20invented%3F)
        1. The frequency with which a behavior is re-invented might provide clues to how easy it is to invent.
        2. Computational and cognitive underpinnings of invention. Boden identifies three distinct creative processes: 
            1. the exploration of an existing framework; 
            2. the combination of existing elements; and 
            3. the transformation of the space of possibilities. 
        3. Concepts are represented in memory such that they afford exploratory variation about their central ‚Äòtheme‚Äô, with nearby variations being easier and more likely than distant ones.
        4. Restructuring the invention space by grouping elements/combinations of similar Empowerment values close by and distancing once that are vastly different?  
            1. When the implications of such concepts intersect, they can be recombined into new concepts; combinations that are ‚Äòclose by‚Äô are easier than those that are distant.

    1. The players‚Äô intrinsic desire to create elements that offer many new successful combinations. 
    2. We therefore, call an element empowering the more distinct elements it can lead to by combination with all other possible elements in the game, provided that the true game tree is known. 
    3. The empowerment value of a combination is the empowerment value of the resulting element‚Äîso the number of elements it can create. 
    4. Without knowledge of the True Game Tree, empowerment requires both a semantic understanding of what elements could come out of a particular combination as well as an intuitive understanding of how combinable the resulting elements could be. 
    5. Afterwards, we address: 
        1. people‚Äôs intuitive semantic understanding of the game and 
        2. how an approximation of this understanding can be integrated into the empowerment model. **more on this‚Ä¶**
    6. Players immediately used elements that they had just created
    very frequently.
        1. The theory is that players had a preference to use an element immediately after creating it if the element had a higher empowerment value-that is the actual number of elements it could lead to. 
    7. Empowerment would require Semantical understanding/approximation of the game tree.

# Understanding the Empowerment Code.

# (Wrong Code) ~~Game Tree Creation~~.

1. set game version: '**alchemy2**', '**alchemy1**', '**joined**', '**tinyalchemy**', '**tinypixels**‚Äô
    1. How are the different choices for ‚Äò**game_version**‚Äô defined?
2. set vector version: split on '**data**' or '**element**', use vector version '**ccen**', '**wiki** or '**crawl**' and dimension 100 or 300 (check what is available)
    1. How are the different choices for ‚Äò**split_version**‚Äô defined?
        1. States what element and combination set is going to be used.
    2. How are the different choices for ‚Äò**vector_version**‚Äô defined?
        1. **vector_version** (str, optional): 'ccen', 'crawl' or 'wiki'. States what element vectors the empowerment info should be based on. Defaults to 'crawl'.
    3. How are the different choices for ‚Äò**dim**‚Äô defined?
3. set version to element (using the main empowerment calculation afterwards) or empowerment (directly training on the empowerment values)
    1. How are the different choices for ‚Äò**model_version**‚Äô defined?
4. How to choose the right value for the #of **CrossValidation splits (k)**? 
    1. //Using k=10 for now. 
5. ‚Äò**prediction_model**‚Äô: 0-link prediction, 1-element prediction or 2-empowerment prediction.
6. **exclude_elements_test** (bool, optional): States whether elements for the test set should be excluded from the training set
or if set splits are created randomly. **exclude_elements_val** (bool, optional): States whether elements for the validation set should be excluded from the training set or if set splits are created randomly. Overwrites **manual_validation** if True.
    1. if **split_version** == 'data':
    exclude_elements_test = False
    exclude_elements_val = False
    elif **split_version** == 'element':
    exclude_elements_test = True
    exclude_elements_val = True
    2. **manual_validation** (float, optional): Fraction of validation split. Defaults to None which means the validation split is done automatically by the model with a 0.2:0.8 ratio (val: train). Is overwritten by **exclude_elements_val**.
7. Need to create ‚Äú**TotemGameParentTable.json**‚Äù
    1. a parent table where each parent has its own dict entry consisting of all resulting children.
